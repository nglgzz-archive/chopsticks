# Chopsticks
This project is an exercise from the Udacity data analysis course.
The goal of this project was to get an introduction on some tools and key steps of the data analysis process, namely:

- clean a dataset
- create some simple visualization of the wrangled data
- test some assumptions
- report conclusions

The exercise consisted in analyzing the results of a study on chopstick lengths, and check if the hypothesis being tested: pinching effectiveness is affected by chopstick length; was true.
